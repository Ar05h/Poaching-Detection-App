# Poaching-Detection-App
Individual project for senior capstone class. A mobile application was developed to help detect poaching using AI-powered analysis of images, sounds, and geolocation data. Users can upload animal photos or audio recordings, and the app uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o to analyze images and Whisper to transcribe and assess animal sounds. All sightings are plotted on an interactive map, with filters to view specific cases. The frontend is built using React Native with Expo, while the backend is developed using Node.js.
